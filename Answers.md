React is a framework in JavaScrpit for building reusable components. React uses a "virtual DOM" that interacts with the actual DOM and updates with specific changes to the actual DOM instead of to the entire DOM which helps web applications run faster.

2. Describe component state.

State determines how a component will behave in the scope of the component.

3. Describe props.

A prop is a JavaScript object that gets passed to the component (like a parameter in functions).

4. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?
